# Development-Accelerator-Challenges

Here is my submission of questions for the Development Accelerator. If there are any changes or additional functionality you would like to see within these problems, please let me know and I will update them accordingly.

I have submitted both the awesome index challenges as HTML files so that they can be seen in the browser. 

Also, I have included some work from last month's Foundation II classes, to better showcase my understanding Javascript. All of these files will begin with "f2" to avoid confusion with the challenge questions.

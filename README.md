# Development-Accelerator-Challenges

Here is my submission of questions for the Development Accelerator. All of the Development Accelerator questions are located inside of the "DevAccelChallenges" folder. If there are any changes or additional functionality you would like to see within these problems, please let me know and I will update them accordingly.

Note: The I have submitted both the awesome index challenges as HTML files so that they can be seen in the browser. 

Also, I have included some work from last month's Foundation II classes and from the current bootcamp, to better showcase my understanding Javascript. 

All of these files will be in a separate folder titled "otherWork". All of the files from foundations II will begin with "f2" to avoid confusion with the files from the current bootcamp, which will begin with "bootcamp"
